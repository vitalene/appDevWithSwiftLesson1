//: ## Comments
//: Programmers leave little notes right in the code to help explain it.
//: This helps people understand the code when they read it later.
//: These notes are called _comments_.
//:
//: Comments are ignored by the playground and do not affect how your code is run.
//: 
//: A comment starts with two slashes `//` :
// This is a comment, it does not affect the code
//34 + 56 + 230
//: Notice that because comments are ignored, no result appears in the results bar for that line of code.
// 200 + 34 + 45
//: - experiment:\
//: Try _commenting out_ the calculation `34 + 56 + 230` by adding two slashes to the beginning of the calculation.\
//:Try _uncommenting_ the calculation `200 + 34 + 45` by deleting the two slashes.\
//:Edit some of the existing expressions and a few of your own.\
//:Notice every time you make a change the results are updated in the sidebar.
