//: ## What is a playground?
//: A playground is a place where you can type code and get results right away. You can play and experiment with code without anything getting in your way. A playground can mix parts that explain things (like this text) with live code that you can change.
//:
//: The simplest _line of code_ you can write is just typing in a number:
764

print("hello world!")

-741


//:ðŸ‘†Notice how the number above looks different?
//: Text that looks like that is *editable code* that you will write or change to make stuff happen!
//:
//: For negative numbers use the minus sign:
-1200
/*:
Notice the numbers also show up in the gray area to the right? ðŸ‘‰

That area is the _results sidebar_. As you add or change code, the playground runs your code again and updates the results in the sidebar.
 
- experiment:
    - Click on a line of code to move the cursor there.
    - Type to start editing code.
    - Change the numbers a few times.
    - Add a few new numbers, each on a separate line.\
Notice every time you make a change the results are updated in the sidebar.

With just single numbers, the results sidebar isnâ€™t telling you anything you didnâ€™t already know. On to the next page.
